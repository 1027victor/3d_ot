Overview
===================================================
**3d-OT leverages the PointNet++ model and optimal transport with soft communication as its foundation.**  Through a modular integration approach, it seamlessly supports single-modal, multi-modal, and diverse spatial omics data from various technologies.  
By precisely extracting meaningful features from positional information, 3d-OT achieves high-resolution analysis of spatial omics data.  Utilizing the framework of **soft communication optimal transport**, it effectively tackles challenges such as 
**non-rigid alignment** and **inconsistent resolution** during the alignment process.  
Furthermore, it introduces a novel evaluation metric, the **Chamfer distance**, to assess alignment quality.
